//
// Let's create a component, FavImages, that will render a list of all of our favorite images. These should be thumbnails - that is, very small versions of the images - in a grid. When you click on an image, it should take you to the route /favorites/:id, which renders the full image in an Image component.
//
// All of the components we're creating today, it's worth noting, are functional components - they don't actually hold any state. By adding a single part of state to our App component, we are expanging the functionality of our site significantly.


//will have to be a link, if you click the search bar, it will refresh the page and you will lose
//all the content on this.state. has to be a link on all the routes, even on the id one. has to be
//link  of the image that needs to be done.
